# Focus Flare

## **What and why?**

**Focus Flare** is a collaborative study platform where students can join timed study sessions and see who else is actively studying in real-time. The app encourages focus by visualizing study progress through an interactive animation that evolves the longer a student studies. It’s designed to create a sense of community and motivation by showing the collective effort of all users. Studying can be tough, but it becomes much more manageable when you’re not doing it alone.

## **For whom?**

For students who are looking for motivation and accountability in their study routines. It’s designed for those who want to enhance their focus by studying alongside others, see who else is actively engaged in their study sessions, and benefit from interactive progress tracking. Whether they are high school students, college students, or lifelong learners, this app supports anyone who seeks a collaborative and motivating study environment.

## **How?**

- **Daily Study Duration Tracking**: This feature allows users to view the total amount of time they have spent studying each day. The study timer automatically resets at midnight EST.
- **Real-Time Study Feed**: A real-time dashboard showing how many people are currently studying. Users can see their friends or other users who are actively in study mode.
- **Interactive Animation:** A cute animated character, plant, or progress bar that evolves the longer users study. As the focus time increases, the animation reflects milestones (e.g., plant grows, character collects items, etc.).
- **Private Study Rooms**: Users can create private virtual study rooms where friends can join a study session together. Options for group focus modes: “Silent Study” (no chat, just visibility) or “Discussion Mode” (study and chat simultaneously).
    
- **Group Study Challenges**: Users can form study groups and set group goals (e.g., complete 5 hours of study by the end of the week). Group members can track collective progress.

## **Scope**

The core features—timed study sessions, real-time visibility, and an evolving animation—are clearly defined and focused. This scope allows the team to implement essential functionalities without becoming overwhelmed by excessive requirements.
